SSchott NIS2LDAP

Set of scripts used to migrate a NIS setup to a simplified LDAP/SSS setup in OpenSUSE. 
Note (grep) all "YOUR" variables written throughout the files, which should be adapted (sed) depending on the server to information.

nis2ldif.py should generate an initial ldap config file by parsing /etc. The output can be used with commands as specified in reset_ldap.sh
activate_ldap.sh should be the minimal commands to enable the setup in the slave nodes.

Check OpenSUSE documentation about the SSS/LDAP setup with 389ds here, and install the packages mentioned: 
https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/security/html/book-security/cha-security-ldap.html

(At least) the following files have to be configured at some point:
/etc/ldap.conf
/etc/nsswitch.conf
/etc/pam.d/* (by pam agent)
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf
